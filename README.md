## Overview
This project is a Weather App built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app provides real-time weather updates for any location by utilizing an external weather API. It's designed to be fully responsive and user-friendly, making it accessible across devices and screen sizes.

## Features
Real-Time Weather Data: Fetches current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
Search Functionality: Users can search for weather information based on city names.
Responsive Design: The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
Dynamic Background: The app changes the background based on the weather conditions (e.g., sunny, cloudy, rainy).
Error Handling: Displays error messages when a city is not found or thereâ€™s a problem with the API request.

## Technologies Used
HTML5 for structuring the web page.
CSS3 for styling and ensuring responsive layouts.
JavaScript for fetching data from the weather API and handling user interactions.
OpenWeatherMap API for retrieving real-time weather data.

## How It Works
Users can enter the name of a city in the search box.
The app sends a request to the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the current weather data for that location.
The weather information, such as temperature, weather conditions, and other details, is displayed dynamically on the page.
The app updates the visuals and background to reflect the weather conditions.
